# CLI Development Rules

This file contains guidelines for working with this project via CLI tools and AI assistants.

## File Operations

- Always read files before modifying them
- Preserve existing code style and formatting
- Use relative paths from project root when possible
- Back up important files before major refactoring

## Testing Commands

- Run tests after any code changes
- Verify output matches expected behavior
- Test both success and failure cases
- Check edge cases and boundary conditions

## Git Workflow

- Create feature branches for new work
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Keep commits atomic and focused
- Review changes before committing

## Code Review

- Check for historical accuracy in cryptographic code
- Verify all encryption operations are reversible
- Ensure documentation is updated with code changes
- Look for potential bugs in rotor stepping logic

## Build and Run

- Test compilation before committing
- Verify runtime behavior with sample inputs
- Check for memory leaks or resource issues
- Validate output formatting

## Documentation

- Update README when adding features
- Document all public APIs and functions
- Include usage examples where helpful
- Explain historical context for cryptographic choices

## Security Considerations

- Note: This is educational code, not for production encryption
- Warn users about historical cipher weaknesses
- Don't use for protecting sensitive data
- Clearly state educational/historical purpose

## Performance

- Performance is secondary to correctness and clarity
- Optimize only after profiling identifies bottlenecks
- Maintain readability over micro-optimizations
- Document any performance-critical sections
