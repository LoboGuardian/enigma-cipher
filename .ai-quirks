# AI Development Quirks and Guidelines

This file contains specific notes and quirks about the Enigma Cipher codebase to help AI assistants understand the project better.

## Project Context

- This is a historical cryptography implementation of the Enigma machine
- Focus on historical accuracy over modern cryptographic security
- Educational purpose - demonstrates WWII-era encryption technology

## Code Patterns

- Rotor mechanics follow authentic Enigma machine behavior
- Reflector ensures symmetric encryption/decryption
- Plugboard provides additional substitution layer
- Rotor stepping follows historical double-stepping mechanism

## Important Constraints

- Maintain historical fidelity in cipher implementation
- All cryptographic operations should be reversible
- Preserve the mechanical limitations of the original machine
- Character set limited to A-Z (uppercase letters only)

## Testing Considerations

- Verify encryption/decryption symmetry
- Test rotor turnover positions
- Validate reflector behavior (no letter encrypts to itself)
- Check double-stepping anomaly implementation

## Documentation Style

- Include historical context where relevant
- Explain the mechanical analogy for digital operations
- Reference historical Enigma variants when applicable
- Provide examples of usage patterns

## Common Pitfalls

- Don't forget rotor position resets between messages
- Remember the double-stepping behavior at turnover positions
- Reflector configuration must not map any letter to itself
- Plugboard pairs must be bidirectional

## Development Priorities

1. Historical accuracy
2. Code clarity and documentation
3. Correctness of cryptographic operations
4. Educational value
5. Performance (secondary concern)
